-- Critical Security Fix: Convert SECURITY DEFINER views to SECURITY INVOKER
-- This addresses the 34 security definer view issues identified by the linter

-- First, let's convert the most critical views to SECURITY INVOKER
-- These views currently bypass RLS and should use querying user permissions

-- Convert booking-related views
